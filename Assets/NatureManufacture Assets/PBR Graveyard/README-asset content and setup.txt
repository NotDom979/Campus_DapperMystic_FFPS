To run HD or IRP versions please visit HD and URP Support Packs folder and check readme files.

We convert HD RP wind into lower engine versions so you could use it at lw, standard and hd rp aswell.

After you import this pack please:
- import unity post processing 2 if you want to use unity post process. It's in unity package manager. Window -> Package Manager -> Post Processing
- change quality level to ultra
- change shadow distance to higher in quality settings at least like 120 or 150
- change color space at player settings to linear as we setup pack to linear rendering
- change render type at graphics settings to deferred. We use many reflection probes at scene and at forward they could be heavy. Ofc you can switch them off and use forward rendering aswell.

Asset contain our foliage trials in foliage trial folder. We put them just to make scene more complex and give you more possibilities:
