Hello,



this package include 5 german ww2 soliders and each of them are animated with all 8 guns.
so, if you want to use one, do you need to disappear the others and then you need to use the 
right animation in mecanim system.


   Walk_status :

   0 = idle;
   1 = walk;


   i suggest to use a rigdoll, to display the dead if required in you game.


   for each weapon counts :

    0 = nothing (this must be on, if you not use this gun)
    1 = idle with gun
    2 = aim
    3 = reload


    and for the k98 is the 4 reload a bullet, because its a bolt action gun.



   the weapon itslf as prefab are also available as exmaple, if you drop one or carry up one.


   the bullet case and rockets are include.
